* What are Streams?
Streams are a sequence of values over time, that’s it.
ex. [0,1,2,3,4]

* What is Reactive Programming?
 Reactive Programming = Streams + Operations

* What is Observable
Observables is a new primitive type which acts as a blueprint for how we want to create streams, 
subscribe to them, react to new values, and combine streams together to build new ones.

* Where we can use Observable in Angular?

There are a few places in Angular where reactive programming and observables are in use.
EventEmitter
Under the hood this works via Observables.
HTTP
We’ve not covered this yet but HTTP requests in Angular are all handled via Observables.
Forms
Reactive forms in Angular expose an observable, a stream of all the input fields in the form combined.

* What is pipe
Pipes are used to transform data, when we only need that data transformed in a template.

* when to use async pipe
when we are using async pipe no need to subscribe in observable and no need to use than for promise.

* How to use acync pipe with promises and observable

What is elvis operater.
"?" sign is called elvis operater, if we are using this operater then data will we check left first,
 if left side is null or undefine then it will not check right else check right.
 it prevent us from error.

* Injectors

* Unit Testing
 jasmin and karma

====================

* built-in validators in angular form(model driven and template).
